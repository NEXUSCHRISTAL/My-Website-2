            <h2>Starting My Journey</h2>
            <p><em>April 11, 2025</em></p>
            <p>
                Welcome to my little corner of the internet. This site is where I'll share my works;
                coding projects, artwork, and other creative experiments. Right now, I'm just starting out,
                but every project you see here is part of my journey to grow as a developer and artist.
            </p>
            <p>
                My goal is simple. Keep learning, keep building, and keep exploring. Whether it's
                a website, a painting, or a new skill, I'll log it here over time. 
                Think of this blog as both a portfolio and a personal quest log.
            </p>
            <p>
                Thanks for stopping by, and stay tuned, there's a lot more to come.

            <h2>My First Project: Weather Outfit App</h2>
            <p><em>October 1, 2025</em></p>
            <p>
                I just launched my first project, the Weather Outfit App! This app helps you choose outfits based on the weather in your city.
                It uses real-time data from the OpenWeather API to give you outfit suggestions that match current conditions.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm excited about this project because it combines my love for coding with practical everyday use. 
                I plan to add more features soon, like auto-detection of your location and more outfit options.
            </p>

            <h2>Exploring New Art Styles</h2>
            <p><em>November 15, 2025</em></p>
            <p>
                Lately, I've been diving into new art styles and techniques. Experimenting with different mediums has been both challenging and rewarding.
                I've started incorporating digital elements into my traditional paintings, blending the two worlds.
            </p>
            <p>
                This exploration is helping me grow as an artist, and I'm excited to see where it takes me. 
                I'll be sharing some of my latest pieces on the artwork page soon, so stay tuned!

            <p><em>December 31, 2025</em></p>
            <p>
                As the year comes to a close, I'm reflecting on all I've learned and created. 
                Looking ahead, I have big plans for 2026. More coding projects, new art pieces, and perhaps even collaborations with other creatives.
            </p>
            <p>
                My focus will be on pushing my boundaries and trying new things. 
                Whether it's learning a new programming language or experimenting with a new art style, I'm ready for the challenge.
            </p>
            <p>
                Thanks for being part of my journey so far. Here's to an exciting year ahead!

            <h2>Reflecting on My Progress</h2>
            <p><em>March 10, 2026</em></p>
            <p>
                It's been a few months since I started this blog, and looking back, I'm proud of the progress I've made.
                From launching my first coding project to exploring new art styles, each step has been a learning experience.
            </p>
            <p>
                I've faced challenges along the way, but each one has taught me something valuable. 
                Whether it's debugging code or mastering a new painting technique, the journey has been worth it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Moving forward, I plan to keep pushing myself and sharing my experiences here. 
                Thanks for following along, and here's to more growth and creativity ahead!
