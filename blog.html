            <h2>Starting My Journey</h2>
            <p><em>April 11, 2025</em></p>
            <p>
                Welcome to my little corner of the internet. This site is where I'll share my works;
                coding projects, artwork, and other creative experiments. Right now, I'm just starting out,
                but every project you see here is part of my journey to grow as a developer and artist.
            </p>
            <p>
                My goal is simple. Keep learning, keep building, and keep exploring. Whether it's
                a website, a painting, or a new skill, I'll log it here over time. 
                Think of this blog as both a portfolio and a personal quest log.
            </p>
            <p>
                Thanks for stopping by, and stay tuned, there's a lot more to come.

            <h2>My First Project: Weather Outfit App</h2>
            <p><em>October 1, 2025</em></p>
            <p>
                I just launched my first project, the Weather Outfit App! This app helps you choose outfits based on the weather in your city.
                It uses real-time data from the OpenWeather API to give you outfit suggestions that match current conditions.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm excited about this project because it combines my love for coding with practical everyday use. 
                I plan to add more features soon, like auto-detection of your location and more outfit options.
            </p>

            <h2>Digital Clock Project</h2>
            <p><em>October 9, 2025</em></p>
            <p>
                I'm thrilled to share my latest coding project, a Digital Clock that not only tells time but also changes themes based on the time of day.
                This project has been a fun challenge, pushing me to learn more about JavaScript and CSS animations.
            </p>
            <p>
                Currently, the clock features themes that shift from day to night. My next goals include adding user-selectable themes like Halloween, fantasy, and cyber themes, as well as an analogue clock display.
            </p>
            <p>
                This project started as a personal challenge to see if I could build a functional clock from scratch, and I'm excited about where it's headed next!

            <h2>Quote Generator Launched!</h2>
            <p><em>October 20, 2025</em></p>
            <p>
                I'm excited to announce the launch of my latest coding project, the Quote Generator! 
                This simple web app delivers motivational quotes at the click of a button, perfect for a quick boost of inspiration.
            </p>
            <p>
                The app is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My next steps include adding categories for different types of quotes (like wisdom, humor, etc.) and implementing social media sharing features.
            </p>
            <p>
                Check it out and let me know what you think!

            <h2>Exploring New Art Styles</h2>
            <p><em>November 15, 2025</em></p>
            <p>
                Lately, I've been diving into new art styles and techniques. Experimenting with different mediums has been both challenging and rewarding.
                I've started incorporating digital elements into my traditional paintings, blending the two worlds.
            </p>

            <p>
                The first two pieces are part of that exploration. I'm trying to capture mood and atmosphere through lighting and color saturation choices.
            </p>
            <p>
                And these last two are studies in the saturation of lighting on faces. I'm fascinated by how light can change the entire feel of a piece.

            </div>
            <p>
                This exploration is helping me grow as an artist, and I'm excited to see where it takes me. 
                I'll be sharing some of my latest pieces on the artwork page soon, so stay tuned!

            <h2>Interrupted</h2>
            <p><em>December 14, 2025</em></p>
            <p>
                I recently updated one of my paintings titled "Interrupted".
            </p>
            <div class="blog-images">
                <img src="20250201_161330~2.jpg" alt="a painting." width="45%">.
                <img src="Updated INTERRUPTED painting.jpg" alt="a painting." width="48%">
            </div>
            <p>
                I wanted to show a deeper sense of disruption and contrast. I decided to add more flowers to help elaborate the foreigness of the red thread and silver needle in the midst of the flowers. I wanted to add dept to the painting by doing so.
            </p>
            <p>
                But to be honest, i am still not fully satisfied with it. I feel like there is more to be done, but i am not sure what yet.
                So i will just say its an updated version for now instead of a finished piece.

            <h2>The Self Between: Wake Me Gently</h2>
            <p><em>December 15, 2025</em></p>
            <p>
                I wrote a book titled "Wake Me Gently", which is under an ungoing book collection titled "The Self Between". I painted a cover for it as well. But i dont think i like how it turned out.
            </p>
            <div class="blog-images">
                <img src="Untitled_Artwork (1).jpg" alt="a painting of a person crying" width="40%">
                <img src="Untitled_Artwork 2.jpg" alt="a painting of a person crying" width="40%">
            </div>
            <p>
                I tried to see how it would look with a different color tone. But unfortunately, i still dont like the outcome of the piece. The focus was ment to be on the eyes which had a lot of regret and sadness in them. But i feel like the colors took away from that focus instead of adding to it.
            </p>
            <p>
                The red toned piece was closer to my original vision for the cover art but it is still lacking.
            </p>
            <p>
                For now, i am just going to postpone the release of the book until i can make a cover that i am satisfied with.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you are interested in reading the book once its released, please contact me through the contact page.
                Or you can stay tuned here for updates. I will post updates about the book and its release date.

            <p><em>December 31, 2025</em></p>
            <p>
                As the year comes to a close, I'm reflecting on all I've learned and created. 
                Looking ahead, I have big plans for 2026. More coding projects, new art pieces, and perhaps even collaborations with other creatives.
            </p>
            <p>
                My focus will be on pushing my boundaries and trying new things. 
                Whether it's learning a new programming language or experimenting with a new art style, I'm ready for the challenge.
            </p>
            <p>
                Thanks for being part of my journey so far. Here's to an exciting year ahead!

            <h2>Reflecting on My Progress</h2>
            <p><em>March 10, 2026</em></p>
            <p>
                It's been a few months since I started this blog, and looking back, I'm proud of the progress I've made.
                From launching my first coding project to exploring new art styles, each step has been a learning experience.
            </p>
            <p>
                I've faced challenges along the way, but each one has taught me something valuable. 
                Whether it's debugging code or mastering a new painting technique, the journey has been worth it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Moving forward, I plan to keep pushing myself and sharing my experiences here. 
                Thanks for following along, and here's to more growth and creativity ahead!
