                <h3>Theatre (version2)</h3>
                <p>This is a different version of my "Theatre" painting. I wasn't fully satisfied with the first version, so I revisited it to give it a focus point and make it more dramatic. The contrast between light and shadow is more pronounced now, giving the piece a stronger theatrical feel.</p>
                <p>
                    I might decide to make a third version in the future, experimenting further with lighting and composition.

                <h3>Theatre (version1)</h3>
                <p>
                    This painting was my first attempt at capturing the dramatic lighting of a theatre scene. While I liked the overall composition, I felt it lacked a strong focal point and the lighting could be more dynamic. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I mainly like that i just decided to go in head first without thinking too much about it. This gave me an opotunity to be bold with my brush strokes and color choices.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This version served as a learning experience for me, and I used what I learned here to create a more refined second version.

                <h3>Interrupted (Updated)</h3>
                <p>This is an updated version of "Interrupted". After selling the first one, I felt like it didn't fully capture what I wanted to express. So, I revisited the piece, adding more details and refining the colors to better convey the emotions behind it. This version feels a little closer to being complete.</p>

                <h3>Untitled (Updated)</h3>
                <p>This was done digitally. I already did a sketch and render of this piece, but upon looking back to it, it was lacking lighting. No focus or intent was in it. Until i tried using what i learnt while painting traditionaly.  
                </p>
                <p>It is currently nameless because i was just experimenting with light.</p>

                <h3>Surrender</h3>
                <p>This painting is meant to show how i see my bestfriend. He is ambitious, but out of fear of not being perfect, he doesn't give it his all. He is self-aware of his strengths and weaknessess but he is currently stock and unwilling to push himself. I hope he doesn't get mad at this description. </p>

                <h3>Untitled</h3>
                <p>This painting was part of my final project piece for my college work. This has been one of my least favorites to paint but for some reason, it has been the first to be sold.</p>

                <h3>Interrupted</h3>
                <p>This painting is about how i see myself. I usually don't have the will to do anything because i usually get bored of things quickly or i am not good at want i want to do, whick is not good for my ego, like at all. But i am starting to try. "Just try" has been something i kept hearing or seeing constanstly so i did. And the result is beginning to speak for it's self.</p>

                <h3>Untitled</h3>
                <p>I realised the kind of love i had for myself when this painting was complete. I just wanted to see what i looked like to myself, but i got to understand myself better with this. To be truthful, i never really understand why people where insecure about their body. It stroke me as strange, until i kept trying to cover up my "inperfections". I decided this was meant to help me understand and be vulnerable with myself so i left in what i felt wasn't right about me.</p>

                <!-- <p>This needs a description.</p> -->
                <p>I would say this is my favorite painting so far. Simply because of what it represents to me. Hope, Want, Desire. I got to have these feelings for the first time in a very long time. I wasn't stock or too afraid my future and what it could be, i was actully living because i wanted to try knew things.</p>
